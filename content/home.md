Hi, I'm **John**.

Some people call me a 'web developer'. Others call me a 'software engineer'. I
simply think of myself as someone who made websites as a way to procrastinate
during his theatre degree.

_Professionally_, I help [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/) continue to exist
at [https://bookshop.org/](https://bookshop.org/) (with the occasional new
feature or improvement).

_Personally_, I build whatever idea sticks around in my head long after the
party has finished and the rest of my brain just wants to go to sleep.

This here website is where some of that ends up.
